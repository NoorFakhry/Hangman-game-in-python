# Algorithm
# =========
# define prog Languages
# split it into separate words
# make the program pick a random word
# and store it in a var pickedLang
# Display a message to the user
# telling him to guess a word
# and give him a hint
# display dashes which indicate a hidden word
# calculate number of choices(len of word + 2)
# declare a won var and assign it to false
# declare a lettersGuessed var
# to store the letters that user guessed
# while there are chances and user didn't win:
# do the following
# display a message to the user
# infroming him how many chances he has left
# and that he will lose chances only
# on wrong guesses
# display a message to the user
# telling him to guess a letter
# and store that letter in a variable
# if that letter is a decimal number
# tell him to guess only a letter or 
# a special char
# elif len of guess is > 1
# tell him to enter only a single letter
# elif guess is in lettersGuessed
# tell him you already guessed that letter
# elif guess is in pickedLang
# calculate number of appearences of that letter
# save the guess with the number of it's appearences in the lettersGuessed var
# loop on pickedLang and display
# the letter if it does exist and the user
# hasn't guessed the whole word already
# and if it doesn't exist display a dash instead
# and in case user has guessed all word correctly
# display a winning message to him
# set won var to true
# which means while loop will terminate
# and won var is true
# if guess is not in pickedLang
# display the current situation
# and decrement chances by one
# after while loop ends
# if won var is false and chances == 0
# display a losing message to user
# and tell him what the word was
